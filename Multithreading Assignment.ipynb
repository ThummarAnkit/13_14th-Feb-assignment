For example, the main thread may wait for worker threads to complete before collecting and processing their results.\n",

    "Deadlocks and race conditions are two common concurrency issues that can occur in multithreaded Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked and waiting for each other to release a resource, resulting in a situation where none of the threads can proceed. Deadlocks can be caused by improper resource locking and unlocking or improper resource sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a scenario where Thread 1 acquires lock A and Thread 2 acquires lock B. Thread 1 then tries to acquire lock B, while Thread 2 tries to acquire lock A. This situation can result in a deadlock, where neither thread can proceed until the other releases its lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions occur when multiple threads access and modify shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable behavior or results. Race conditions can be caused by improper synchronization, such as when threads don't properly coordinate access to shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a scenario where two threads are incrementing a shared variable at the same time. If both threads read the variable, increment it, and then write it back, there's a chance that they will overwrite each other's changes, resulting in incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid deadlocks and race conditions in Python, you can use synchronization primitives such as locks, semaphores, and barriers to coordinate access to shared resources. You can also use thread-safe data structures and design your program to minimize shared state as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, deadlocks and race conditions are two common concurrency issues that can occur in multithreaded Python programs. Proper synchronization and resource management can help prevent these issues and ensure that your program runs correctly and efficiently."
